# File Metadata Microservice

This is the [File Metadata project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice) required for the FreeCodeCamp Backend certification.

The project was developed from the Javascript [boilerplate repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/) from FCC.

The project was submitted to FCC [as a replit](https://replit.com/@PRBorges/FileMetadata-FCC). It should be live at [](https://FileMetadata-FCC.prborges.repl.co).

## Endpoints

* GET / provides a basic form to upload the file to be analyzed.
